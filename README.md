# Reddit Purge
Want to get off Reddit?
Are you done and want to go back to anonymity (or maybe start fresh)?
Unfortunately, Reddit will not provide you with an easy way to delete your account history, you can only deactivate your account, leaving everything you created untouched.
You can always delete your posts and comments history manually, but that can take hours, depending on how active you were.
In addition, Reddit does not have an API to delete your comments history.
There have been some attempts at this using browser developer tools and such, but it wasn't working for me.

This app uses Selenium (browser automation tool) and .NET Core (cross platform development platform) to automate Chrome and simulate a user launching a browser, logging in to Reddit and manually deleting his entire history.
This might take a few hours, and is completely irreversible. So, proceed with great caution.
